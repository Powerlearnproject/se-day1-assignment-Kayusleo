# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering(SE) is the systematic application of the engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality system. 
SE plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software application and systems that power various aspect of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestone include the development of programming languages (e.g., fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s the advent of structure programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software developer: for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: oversee the planing, execution and delivery of software projects
System Architect: design the overall structure and architecture of software system
UI/UX Designer: create user interfaces and design user experiences for software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are two popular project management methodologies used in software development and other industries. Here's a comparison of the two:

Waterfall Methodology:

- Linear and sequential approach
- Phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
- Each phase completed before moving to the next one
- Predictive and plan-driven
- Changes are difficult and costly to implement once the project starts

Agile Methodology:

- Iterative and incremental approach
- Focus on flexibility and adaptability
- Emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement
- Projects divided into sprints or iterations
- Changes can be incorporated quickly and easily


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: oversee the planing, execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight Deadline
Technical Debt
Strategies for overcoming them includes, effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of task, regular reassessment of project goals and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: testing individual unit or modules of softwares.
Integration: testing interaction between different components 
System: testing the whole software system
Acceptance: testing the software against user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is all about crafting question or statement to get the best possible response from AI models
Prompt Engineering helps in getting a clear and specific answer when asking vague question

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example, if you ask, tell me about dog, the AI might give a general answers
But if you ask, tell me about the history of dogs, you'll get a more focused answers
